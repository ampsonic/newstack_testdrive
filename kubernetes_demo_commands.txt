The following files are in the kube_yaml directory

# Create the PVC. Check that it is created on the Pure
kubectl apply -f 1_createPVC.yaml

# Creates Minio Deployment
kubectl apply -f 2_minio.yaml

kubectl apply -f 3_service.yaml

# You can now log in to minio using the service port. Find the port with the kubectl get svc (should always be 9000) command. http://<linuxIP>:<port> Username/password: minio:minio123
# Continuing with the rest of the commands, which will take a snap and clone a new PVC from that snapshot
# You can then continue with spinning up a new minio instance (default will be port 9001)

# Don't forget that adding the snapshot spec adds the below object type
kubectl get VolumeSnapshots
